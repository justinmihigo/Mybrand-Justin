                <h3 class="color">A Brief History of React.js</h3>
                <p class="padding justify">Facebook created React.js in 2011 for their own use. As you know, Facebook is one 
                    of the biggest Social Networking websites in the world today.
                    In 2012, Instagram also started using it, which is a subsidiary of Facebook.
                    In 2013, Facebook made React.js open-sourced. Initially, the developer community 
                    rejected it because it used Markup and JavaScript in a single file. But as more people 
                    experimented with it, they started embracing the component-centric approach for separating 
                    concerns.
                    In 2014, many large companies started using React.js in their production environments.
                    In 2015, Facebook open-sourced React Native too. It is a library that allows us to create native 
                    mobile apps in Android and iOS using React.js.
                    In 2016, with version 15, React.js started using Semantic Versioning. This also helped convey 
                    to the developer's community that React was more stable.
                    Today, React.js is used by many Fortune 500 companies. Facebook has full-time React development 
                    staff. They regularly release bug fixes, enhancements, blog posts, and documentation.
                    Why Should You Use React?
                    You must be wondering why you should use React.js. After all, as the uses of JavaScript have
                     increased in recent years, we now have multiple options available in the market like Angular 
                     and Vue.js. So, why React?
                    Let's explore six key reasons to use React.js.

                <h3 class="color">React is Flexible</h3>
                <p class="padding justify">
                    React is remarkably flexible. Once you have learned it, you can use
                     it on a vast variety of platforms to build quality user interfaces. 
                     React is a library, NOT a framework. Its library approach has allowed 
                     React to evolve into such a remarkable tool.
                    React was created with a single focus: to create components for web applications.
                    A React component can be anything in your web application like a Button, Text, Label, or Grid.
                    But as React's popularity is grown, its ecosystem has also grown to cover various use cases.
                    You can generate a static site with React using tools like Gatsby. You can use React Native
                     to build mobile apps. You can even create Desktop applications using a tool like Electron, 
                     which can run on mac and windows with React.js technology.
                    React also supports server rendering of its components using tools like Next.js. You can also
                     use React.js to create a virtual reality website and 360 experiences using React VR.
                    "Learn React Once and Write Everywhere" - Reactjs.org
                    You can use React in your existing apps too. React was designed keeping this in mind.
                     You can change a small part of your existing application by using React, and if that 
                     change works, then you can start converting your whole application into React.js. Facebook 
                     used the same approach.
                    "The main advantage of using a Library over a Framework is that Libraries are lightweight, 
                    and there is a freedom to choose different tools. The Framework consists of an entire ecosystem
                     to build an application, and you don't have an easy way to use any other tools outside the
                      Framework."
